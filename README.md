# etch-a-sketch
I spent too much time on this project than I had to because I wanted to add a shading function where the cells would progressively darken when sketching and I couldn't figure it out. I, however, was able to implement the major requirements of the etch-and-sketch project.

### Functionalities
* **Slider**: Use the slider to set the size of your canvas. It ranges from 2x2 to 100x100.
* **Color Picker**: Use this to select what color you want to draw in.
* **Rainbow Button**: Unlike the color picker, which lets select one color to draw with, the rainbow button allows you to draw using random colors generated by the computer.
* **Erase Button**: This erases by pixel.
* **Clear Button**: This erases anything you have on your canvas.

> PS: I haven't styled the project yet. I might return this in order to do so.
